### Project Purpose

Since the pandemic entered our lives, we have started to spend a much larger part of our lives online. Although working from home sounds like a very comfortable alternative, working at a desk for hours without the right precautions causes many orthopedic problems, especially in the neck, waist and wrists. Although the designs of the mice and keyboards we use to interact with the computer are not at all suitable for our body anatomy, there is a great ignorance in this regard, and unfortunately, people who spend long periods of time with the computer may encounter an orthopedic disorder, which modern medicine has not yet found a definitive solution to, which can lead to their inability to use a computer at an unexpected moment.

 As someone who has been experiencing orthopedic discomfort in their hands for 2 years, I wanted to create an alternative way of interacting with a computer in this project. The second aim of the project is that the person does not feel uncomfortable during the use of this alternative method, and that the system I will build is aesthetic and in size that will not prevent the person from working in environments such as offices or libraries. I hope that in the future, with the interaction ways similar to and much better than this project, we will manage to both enable people with disorders to use the computer effectively and naturally again, and prevent people who are still healthy from getting orthopedic disorders by using different interaction ways.

Note: Start using ergonomic keyboards and vertical mouses to prevent injuring your wrists and arms please. Also, exercise...
